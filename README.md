# Tweet-Generator

### About: 
#### Here's a website where you can easily make a faked tweet to trick your friends. <br>

### It is divided into two areas:
1. the top of which allows you to enter user information, tweets, dates and times, as well as tweet stats.
2.  You can see a preview of how the tweet will look at the bottom of the website, as well as a button to download the tweet to show to your friends. (as of now the downlod button takes a screenshot and outputs it bellow the preview, you will have to manually save the picture)
